# Boston Bike Traffic Map

This project presents an interactive D3.js + Mapbox-based visualization of bike traffic across Boston and Cambridge using Bluebikes data. Users can explore how traffic volume and flow vary throughout the day, visualized through dynamic circle sizes and color-coded directions at each station. A time slider allows filtering trips by time of day, revealing shifting patterns of bike usage.

Built using D3.js and Mapbox GL JS. Deployed via GitHub Pages.
